When we can neglect the left or right part by finding a possible/not possible solution on a sorted answer search space, we can use BINARY SEARCH.

We can use storing answer method for all problems. But, at the end before returning answer, check for corner cases.
Ex. pivot element/peak of mountain etc.

When whole array is not sorted, but some subarrays of it are sorted then try to draw lines to find logic.

In problems like aggresive cows or allocate books, where we have to create our own search space, trick to identify problems is that: 0. Everything is contiguos.

1. In aggresive cows, we are asked for max value of min distance between the two cows.
2. In allocate books, we are asked for min value of max pages allowed to student. Simalarly, in painter's partition problem, we are asked for minimum value of maximum time given to individual painter.

Where we have to find minimum value, no. of distributions can be <= given candidates.
Ex. in book allocation problem, all books can be distributed among <= k students for given limit.

Where we have to find maximum value, no. of distributions can be >= given candidates.
Ex. in aggresive cows problem, no. of cows that can be placed safely can be ">= k" for the given limit.


Binary search can also be used on number ranges. They are naturally sorted.
