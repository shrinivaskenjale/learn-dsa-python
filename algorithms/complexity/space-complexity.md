# Space complexity:

It is amount of extra memory (memory apart from the input)
taken by algorithm to run as a function of size of the input.

O(1) => simple variables, array of fixed size(irrespective of input size)
O(n) => container data structures like arrays whose size depends on input
size.

# Recursive functions:

Add following complexities:

1. Recursion call stack will take some space which will be equal to maximum
   depth of recursion tree.

2. If you create extra space before calling recursive functions, add all
   extra spaces of longest path.
   But if you create space after finishing the recursive calls, space will be
   maximum space at any node of the longest path in recursion tree.
