# Time complexity and asymptotic notations:

Time complexity: It is amount of time taken by algorithm to run as a function
of size of the input.

When size of input is large, we consider only order of growth of the running time w.r.t. input size. For this we use Asymptotic Notations.

Notations to represent complexity:
Big O: upper bound complexity
Theta: average case complexity
Omega: lower bound complexity

# Time complexities in increasing order:

O(1)
O(logN)
O(N)
(NlogN)
O(N^2), O(N^3) ...
O(2^N), O(3^N) ...
O(N!)
O(N^N)

# Big O notation calculation:

1. ignore lower degree terms
2. ignore any constants

Examples:
2n^2 + 3n => n^2
4n^4 + 3n^3 => n^4
n^2 + logn => n^2
1234 => 1
3N^3 + 2n^2 + 5 => n^3
(n^3)/200 => n^3
5n^2 + logn => n^2
n/4 => n
(n+4)/4 => n

# Steps to find time complexity of functions:

Since we are finding big O notation, always take worst case of each
statement.

Add complexities of all statements in an function.

Variable assignments have linear complexity.

For iteration, count number of iterations in terms of user input.
Multiply the count of iteratinos with maximum complexity of body of loop.
If iterations are nested, multiply count of each iteration.
In case of nested loop which depends upon outer loop variable, consider worst
case i.e., maximum number of times inner loop executes.

For recursion, refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCsfk2ei2R8

1. Build tree for time complexity for each call assuming that calling
   recursive function is O(1).
2. Add time complexities of each function calls in each level.
3. Add time complexities of all levels.

If only few recursive calls execute inside recursive function, consider the
one which goes deep or which reaches slowly to base condition.

Sometimes, you need to find out number of levels, in that case, convert input
size at each level in some common formula in terms of constant k and finally
compare that value with your base case.

# Common time complexities:

Let n be the main variable in the problem.

If n ≤ 12, the time complexity can be O(n!).
If n ≤ 25, the time complexity can be O(2^n).
If n ≤ 100, the time complexity can be O(n^4).
If n ≤ 500, the time complexity can be O(n^3).
If n ≤ 10^4, the time complexity can be O(n^2).
If n ≤ 10^6, the time complexity can be O(n log n).
If n ≤ 10^8, the time complexity can be O(n).
If n > 10^8, the time complexity can be O(log n) or O(1).

Computer can perform around 10^8 operations in 1 second. So if time limit is
given you can identify expected time complexity.

# Master's theorem

Using Master's theorem, you can find time complexity of any recursive
function using recurrence relation.
